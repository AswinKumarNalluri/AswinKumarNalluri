## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Cognizant (_August 2021 - July 2022_)
- As a Track Lead, possessing deep domain knowledge my main responsibilities include identifying new patterns and tactics evolving over time in fraud activities, preventing the model from shifting to a high anomaly ratio, and maintaining a low anomaly ratio through continuous monitoring and updates to maintain model's effectiveness.
- Executed and maintained end-to-end development of production-level Stage 1 unsupervised learning models, including autoencoder neural networks and Isolation Forest, to flag 80 to 90% of fraudulent transactions.

**Data Science Consultant @ Shawhin Talebi Ventures LLC (_December 2020 - Present_)
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis for novel study evaluating the impact of over 300 biometrics variables on human performance in hyper-realistic, live-fire training scenarios
- Applied unsupervised deep learning approaches to longitudinal ICU data to discover novel sepsis sub-phenotypes

## Projects
### A Smart Hybrid Enhanced Recommendation and Personalization Algorithm using Machine Learning
[Publication](https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/etd/1866/)

Our Smart Hybrid Enhanced Recommendation and Personalization Algorithm (SHERPA) represents a groundbreaking leap forward in machine learning. Unlike traditional recommender systems, SHERPA intelligently blends both Content-based filtering with Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)  and Collaborative filtering  with Alternating Squares (ALS) with Weighted Regularization along with other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Trained on a massive dataset of over 50 million ratings from 480,000 unique users across 17,770 movie titles on the CSUSB Supercomputer, SHERPA has demonstrated a remarkable 70% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to traditional hybrid models, as measured by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
