## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Cognizant (August 2021 - July 2022_)
- As a Track Lead, possessing deep domain knowledge my main responsibilities include identifying new patterns and tactics evolving over time in fraud activities, preventing the model from shifting to a high anomaly ratio, and maintaining a low anomaly ratio through continuous monitoring and updates to maintain model's effectiveness.
- Executed and maintained end-to-end development of production-level Stage 1 unsupervised learning models, including autoencoder neural networks and Isolation Forest, to flag 80 to 90% of fraudulent transactions.

**Data Science Intern @ Cognizant India (March 2021 - July 2021)
- Worked on documentation and assisted in developing and integrating APIs for fraud detection algorithms as well as deployment and monitoring activities alongside senior data scientists.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on time series data to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies, providing actionable insights for the fraud detection team and created data visualizations using Power BI or Tableau. 
- Implemented advanced feature engineering (transaction frequency, rolling statistics, seasonal patterns) and performed data aggregation/segmentation (hourly, daily, weekly) to enhance fraud detection model accuracy and highlight high-risk patterns.

### A Smart Hybrid Enhanced Recommendation and Personalization Algorithm using Machine Learning

Our Smart Hybrid Enhanced Recommendation and Personalization Algorithm (SHERPA) represents a groundbreaking leap forward in machine learning. Unlike traditional recommender systems, SHERPA intelligently blends both Content-based filtering with Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)  and Collaborative filtering  with Alternating Squares (ALS) with Weighted Regularization along with other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Trained on a massive dataset of over 50 million ratings from 480,000 unique users across 17,770 movie titles on the CSUSB Supercomputer, SHERPA has demonstrated a remarkable 70% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to traditional hybrid models, as measured by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

### Assessment of GNSS Raw Measurements Based on GNSS Logger at Low Latitudes Stations

Many positioning and navigation systems cannot provide accurate results in remote areas due to high ionospheric error. To overcome this, we have used GNSS raw measurements for accurate positioning. We collect GNSS raw measurement data from the International Global Navigation Satellite Systems (IGS) and the GNSS Logger App using an Android mobile in RINEX format. We calculate pseudo ranges between the user receiver and the satellite, and by using L1or L2 frequency, position, velocity, and time. Deriving ASCII files from RINEX records using GPS-TEC, Seemala 2004 software generates graphs, and finally by using MATLAB code to forecast position correction.
