## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Cognizant (_August 2021 - July 2022_)
- As a Track Lead, possessing deep domain knowledge my main responsibilities include identifying new patterns and tactics evolving over time in fraud activities, preventing the model from shifting to a high anomaly ratio, and maintaining a low anomaly ratio through continuous monitoring and updates to maintain model's effectiveness.
- Executed and maintained end-to-end development of production-level Stage 1 unsupervised learning models, including autoencoder neural networks and Isolation Forest, to flag 80 to 90% of fraudulent transactions.

**Data Science Consultant @ Shawhin Talebi Ventures LLC (_December 2020 - Present_)
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis for novel study evaluating the impact of over 300 biometrics variables on human performance in hyper-realistic, live-fire training scenarios
- Applied unsupervised deep learning approaches to longitudinal ICU data to discover novel sepsis sub-phenotypes

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
